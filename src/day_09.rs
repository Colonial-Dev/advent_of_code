//! # Day 9 - Rope Bridge
//! 
//! Puzzle opened on time. 
//! - P1 completed @ 00:51:10 (7331)
//! - P2 completed @ 02:42:44 (10526)
//! 
//! Fun fact - `2577` and `2557` are apparently considered equivalent by my brain!
//! 
//! ... I misread my program giving me a correct answer (the latter) as the former.
//! This took me an hour to figure out.
//! ***AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-***
//! 
//! ## Parsing
//! My initial approach parsed each line into a `Movement` struct, containing a
//! `count` and `direction` field. 
//! 
//! However, once I understood the entire problem, I realized it would be better to simply 
//! eliminate the `Movement` struct altogether, flattening each instruction from `DIRECTION COUNT` into
//! `DIRECTION` repeated `COUNT` times. 
//! 
//! This means I don't have to worry about breaking up each movement command into sub-steps
//! when solving the problem; that logic has been hoisted to parse time.
//! 
//! ## Solutions
//! My initial solution was (like yesterday) a hot mess of `for` loops that (predictably) blew apart
//! at the seams when exposed to part two. I scraped together what logic I could salvage and wrote
//! a [`Rope`] type that manages an internal buffer of knot coordinates and a [`HashSet`] tracking all the
//! coordinates visited by the rope's tail knot.
//! 
//! Both solutions are identical, apart from the number of knots specified when constructing their [`Rope`].
//! They loop over each direction from the input, first calling [`Rope::move_head`] (which is a simple `match`
//! statement that increments/decrements the appropriate head coordinate), then [`Rope::update_positions`] to
//! realign all the trailing knots. The position update algorithm goes roughly like this:
//! 1. Iterate over all the indices in the range `1..knot_buffer.len()`.
//! 2. Obtain the knots at `index - 1` (the current "head") and `index` (the current "tail".)
//! 3. Compute the x-axis and y-axis difference between the head and tail.
//! 4. If the absolute value of the x/y differences is both `<= 1`, we don't need to update anything and
//! continue iteration.
//! 5. Otherwise: 
//!     - If the absolute value of the x/y differences is both `!= 0`, we increment the tail's
//! x and y coordinates by the sign number of the respective difference.
//!     - Else if the absolute value of the x difference is `>= 2`, increment the tail's x
//! coordinate by the sign number of the x difference.
//!     - Ditto for the y difference being `>= 2`.
//! 6. Once iteration is complete, update the tracking [`HashSet`] with the current coordinates of the
//! rope tail.
//! 
//! Once all the movement instructions are exhausted, the answer for both parts can be obtained using
//! `rope.hash_set.len()`.
