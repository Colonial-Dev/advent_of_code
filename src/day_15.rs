//! # Day 15 - Beacon Exclusion Zone
//! 
//! Puzzle opened on time. 
//! - P1 completed @ 02:00:28 (6772)
//! - P2 completed @ 20:15:24 ðŸ¥´ (20963)
//! 
//! No joke, I think I had to rewrite my exclusion zone generator and range merger functions like, ten times.
//! I'm honestly amazed I got part one right with how many errors there were, and all those hidden bugs came out in full force
//! to bite me in the ass for part two.
//! 
//! My final solution for part two takes about 1.6 seconds to execute. No, I am not optimizing it, I'm fucking tired of grid/coordinate math.
//! 
//! ## Parsing
//! Parsing was pretty easy; I *did* manage to blow my own foot off by not preserving any negative signs present in the input
//! when filtering, but I managed to catch that bug fairly early and resolved it.
//! 
//! ## Solutions
//! My initial part one solution took the naive path - generating every point covered by the beacons, filtering out all those not
//! in the target row, deduping them and tallying them up. This took several hundred milliseconds, but hey, it worked!
//! 
//! Then along comes part two, and any hope of code reuse goes up in smoke. I did the math, and even running at full tilt, it would take
//! over a month (!) to scan the entire beacon space using the brute force method. Even if I maximally parallelized it (using all 12 threads in my machine)
//! it would still take three days or so, which clearly wasn't going to work.
//! 
//! So, I needed an alternate solution! ...Unfortunately, after a few hours of trying various geometrical tricks that all turned out to be either inapplicable or still
//! hilariously inefficient, I ended up putting it on hold and going to sleep.
//! 
//! In the afternoon, I ended up taking the less-efficient but still workable approach of ranges - instead of generating *every single point* covered by the sensors
//! (which, by the way, was enough to get my program OOM killed on a 32 gigabyte machine - the only reason P1 worked was because I had the foresight to generate points lazily),
//! we could just compute the X-coordinate ranges they cover at each Y-level, merging them all together to determine if there's any open spaces within the bounding box. 
//! 
//! This took *far* more work than it should have to get right, and even once I had a working merger function, my initial attempts at scanning each row were hilariously slow (on the order
//! of a day-ish to completion) because I was doing a linear scan-and-filter of the *entire* range set for *every* Y-level, like a moron. The "proper" solution turned out to be sorting the entire
//! set based on Y-level, then draining sections from the bottom-up to merge and check them for holes.
//! 
//! ... I mean, it's good enough for government work?
